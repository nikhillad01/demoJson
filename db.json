In terms of incremental economic value creation, the IIT graduates have been associated with over $450 billion across the sectors and have also been involved in the creation of over 20 million new jobs. One in 100 IIT alumni has started his own company with over 40 per cent of them being serial entrepreneurs. Two-thirds of the companies founded are in India. The other interesting point is that 54 per cent of the top 500 Indian companies have at least one IIT alumnus on their board and these companies have a cumulative revenue that is ten times greater than that of other companies on the list. Makes sense now? EDIT: Adding to the content... People seem to think we are deliberately making over-hyped stories. Well, let&apos;s hear what others have to say about IITs and IIT Alumni.",
